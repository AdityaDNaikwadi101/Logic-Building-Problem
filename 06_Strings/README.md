# 📌 Problems on String (C Programming)

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains **String-based problem-solving programs in C**.
The focus is on **real-world text processing**, where character data is validated,
analyzed, searched, modified, and transformed efficiently.

String handling is a core requirement in **system software, backend services,
data validation modules, and input processing layers**.  
These programs strengthen fundamentals required to work with such systems.

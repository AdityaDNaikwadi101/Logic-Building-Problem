# 📌 Problems on N Numbers (C Programming)

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains **Problems on N Numbers implemented using Arrays in C**.
The focus is on **real-world problem solving**, where numerical data is processed,
analyzed, searched, modified, and managed efficiently.

These programs help build a **strong logical foundation**, which is essential for
developing reliable and maintainable software systems.

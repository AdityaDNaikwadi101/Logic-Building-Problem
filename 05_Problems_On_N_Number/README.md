📌 Problems on N Numbers (C Programming)
📖 Overview

This module focuses on real-world problem solving using N numbers and arrays in C.
The programs are designed to build a strong foundation in data processing, memory handling, and logical decision-making, which are essential in practical software development and system-level programming.

Each program demonstrates how raw numerical data can be analyzed, transformed, searched, and updated efficiently, similar to tasks performed in real applications.
